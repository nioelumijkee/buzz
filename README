########### buzz~ #################

buzz~ generates a signal from a set of harmonically related partials. 
Amplitude and number of these partials are controllable. 

INLETS
left to right

Frequency:
Sets the fundamental frequency in Hz.

Phase:
Sets the phase of the internal phasor object. Normally not needed.


H: 
The highest partial is controlled by a value called "H" which sets the highest
generated (integer) multiple of the fundamental frequency. 

a: 
The amplitudes of the partials are controlled by an inlet "a". Each sine
component of the signal is scaled by pow(a, k). An a-value of 1 gets ignored,
because it would lead to a division by 0. One should set a to values 0 < a < 1
in typical setups, as values greater 1 can quickly lead to aliasing (which could
be wanted, too)

Help patch: 
The help patch gives an example for using buzz~. It incorporates the dsp-object
from the IEMLIB for PD, but it will work without it as well, you will just get
some error messages on startup.
